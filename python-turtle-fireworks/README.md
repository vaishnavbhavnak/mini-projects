Python Turtle Fireworks – New Year Animation

This project uses Python Turtle graphics to create a realistic firework animation.
A rocket launches from the bottom of the screen, explodes in mid-air, and turns into multiple glowing particle streaks that spread outward. Gravity and gradual speed reduction are applied to make the explosion look natural.

The “HAPPY NEW YEAR!” text updates continuously with random colors to add a festive effect while the fireworks repeat infinitely.

Concepts used in this project:

Turtle graphics animation

Randomized angles, speed, and colors

Basic physics simulation (gravity and deceleration)

Optimized animation using tracer() and update()

Infinite loop animation logic

Suitable for Python beginners who want to learn animation, motion simulation, and creative coding using Turtle graphics.

Tip: Try changing particle count, gravity value, or colors to create different firework patterns.
